Got questions but you're in a hurry?  You can chat with real live librarians and researchers from LibraryH3lp who volunteer their time to help point you in the right direction!

LibraryH3lp can't help deliver groceries or find TP in stock, but they probably can point you to a page that does help.  They're librarians or researchers, after all, and they're really good at finding trusted and useful sources for you, just like at your local library.

## Ask A Librarian

If you've got questions, but can't get to Robbins or Fox libraries these days, then try asking LibraryH3lp in the chat below!

This service is run by chat volunteers around the US; in terms of scheduling (i.e. when they are available and timeliness of responses), they note: 

> We try to stay online as much as possible, but please bear with us if we are not online at all hours. We will do our best to reply to messages sent while we are offline within two hours, and by 10 am EST if sent after 10 pm EST. Our volunteers are currently located in the United States.

## Reminder: All Chats Are Logged

This chat service is staffed by COVID Resource Librarian volunteers from around the US, not by local Arlington, MA volunteers.  They have their own [data privacy policy](https://www.covidresourcelibrarian.com/about), and their chat tool above may log IP addresses and may save chats for their own internal work.  Questions about how this site uses chat can be sent to [our website administrator](mailto:MutualAidArlington@gmail.com?Subject=[MAA] Chat Question).  You can also read the [technical details of how LibraryH3lp chat works](/setup/chat/).
