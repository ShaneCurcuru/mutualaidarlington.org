Working from home and can't connect?  Figuring out how to setup video calls?  Missing a cable, or need computer help?  We have lots of geek volunteers in Arlington you can reach out to.  There's even volunteers with Fix-It Clinic who can advise on fixing hardware and gadgets!

## Get Technology Help

[View our list of computer technology volunteers](/techhelp) who may be able to help you.  Please remember: [these geeks are all volunteers](/techhelp) with busy lives, so give them time to respond, and be sure to say thanks!

**Have a hardware or gadget problem?** If some other electronics around the house aren't working, and you're willing to try fixing it yourself, then the [Fixit Clinic](https://fixitclinic.blogspot.com/) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FixitClinic/"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a> has volunteers here in Arlington too!  Here's how:

If you need electronic gadgets or tools fixed, fixed you can sign up to have a virtual fixit clinic session **if you**:

- Have a computer and internet connection that will support video teleconferencing?
- Can you show and describe the problem / recreate the problem in under five minutes?
- Can you have some rudimentary disassembly tools at the ready?
- Can you fill out the [Broken Item Fixit Report](https://bit.ly/brokenitemreport) afterwards?
- **If yes to all steps above** then [register for a Virtual Fixit Clinic](https://bit.ly/fixitcheckin) and a Fixit Coach will reach about scheduling you for an upcoming Virtual Fixit Clinic.

## Volunteer To Help

Are you a geek who can help?  Volunteer your tech skills here for any Arlington residents by [filling in our Google Form for tech volunteers](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67).

[See the techhelp page](/techhelp), now a searchable, categorized list of people available.  If there's interest, we might be able to allow tech volunteers to do so semi-anonymously, only sharing contact details with specific people looking for help.

**NOTE:** Currently Shane is building this site, although I'm talking to a few other Arlingtonians about coordinating efforts.  If you want to help maintain this meta-coordination site, please [submit the Tech Volnteer Form](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67) and tick the box for site admin.
