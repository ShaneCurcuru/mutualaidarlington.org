**Pods are hyperlocal text message groups or phone trees of you and your neighbors.** Since not everyone has access to online communication, neighborhood pods are how we reach more people. 

## Volunteer To Setup An Arlington Helps Pod

[Arlington Helps](https://www.arlingtonhelps.org/) is asking for folks to sign up as **Neighborhood Point People**, where youâ€™d take on the responsibility of reaching out to your neighbors, moderating a neighborhood group chat or phone tree (on WhatsApp or another communication tool), and staying in touch with the other point people for resource sharing.

If you have the capacity to take on this role, please let [Arlington Helps organizers](https://www.arlingtonhelps.org/pods) know, and they will set you up with a [toolkit](https://tinyurl.com/how-to-pod-arlington) of how to get started.
