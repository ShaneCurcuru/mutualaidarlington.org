**Pods are hyperlocal text message groups or phone trees of you and your neighbors.** Since not everyone has access to online communication, neighborhood pods and other efforts below are how to connect and help your local neighbors. 

## Got Stuff To Share With Neighbors? Use Free Shelves!

Volunteers in town are organizing [Neighborhood Free Shelves](https://www.freeshelves.org/) on their streets.  Have stuff you don't need, but is too good to throw out?  Looking for something useful, but can't afford it (or no time to shop)?  Talk with your neighbors about setting up your own Free Shelves - a local version of the [popular Everything Is Free](https://mutualaidarlington.org/books/#little-free-libraries-and-book-swaps-in-town) [group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EIFArlingtonMA/)!

## Volunteer To Setup An Arlington Helps Pod

[Arlington Helps](https://www.arlingtonhelps.org/) is asking for folks to sign up as **Neighborhood Point People**, where youâ€™d take on the responsibility of reaching out to your neighbors, moderating a neighborhood group chat or phone tree (on WhatsApp or another communication tool), and staying in touch with the other point people for resource sharing.

If you have the capacity to take on this role, please let [Arlington Helps organizers](https://www.arlingtonhelps.org/pods) know, and they will set you up with a [toolkit](https://tinyurl.com/how-to-pod-arlington) of how to get started.
