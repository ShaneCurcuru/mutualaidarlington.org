Now that many local towns require masks, and the [CDC recommends wearing cloth masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) when going out, we're all wondering where to get one for ourselves, or where to donate extra masks or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to those who need them.

_Need a mask for home use?_ See the [list of local Arlingtonians sewing cloth masks for sale](/buymasks/) to neighbors! 

## Donate Masks Or PPE

- [Donate Masks To Arlington](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/departments/health-human-services/health-department/coronavirus-information/donate-personal-protective-equipment) - the town has a simple form for listing what masks (N95, surgical, fabric) or PPE you can donate to first responders and hospitals, and [showcases how many donations have been made](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/c8d77b51-3ddb-4b48-8158-5061f8fc3f13/page/cyCKB).
- [MaskOn builds full masks for hospital use](https://maskson.org), and a local Arlingtonian is working with AHS students as a distribution point for them.
- [Donate Masks To MA State](mass.gov/covid-ppxy) - Statewide portal coordinating mask and other PPE donations or sales with regional needs.
- [Mask Match](https://www.mask-match.com/) - Works directly with healthcare peeps who need masks and individual donors, so you can mail masks directly to someone in need.
- [GetUsPPE](https://getusppe.org/give/) - Map of hospitals and other locations that accept donations of PPE.
- [Project N95](https://www.projectn95.org/) - working with suppliers to get PPE masks and supplies to the right places.

## Make Your Own Masks

Reminder: hospitals often have restrictions on designs or materials - but first responders, the elderly, and plenty of other people need masks too!  All masks you make will be useful.

- [Laura's Sewing School](https://www.laurassewingschool.com/) **right here in Arlington** has mask-making organized, with patterns, supply kits, and helps distribute directly to groups in town in need.
- [Maker Mask](https://makermask.org/) provides designs that incorporate fabric from reuseable shopping bags, including some links to [research on effectiveness](https://makermask.org/background/).
- [Masks For All](https://masks4all.co/) aims to be a comprehensive website about the benefits of wearing home-made masks; site translated into multiple languages so very useful for some communities.
- [Coronavirus Tech Handbook - Masks](https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/masks) - is a laundry list of various how-to guides, programs, and scientific research on different kinds of masks.  Well worth reading to find some serious research about mask effectiveness and best practices.

## Buying A Mask

With many of the regular retailers sold out, or backordered, it takes some planning.  See a [**list of Arlingtonians selling masks**](/buymasks/) - many are using great patterns with good designs and different sizes.  There are also many sites or videos online for making simple masks out of bandannas, t-shirts, or best yet: high thread count sheets.

Remember to [**always put your mask on safely**](https://www.sfcdcp.org/communicable-disease/healthy-habits/how-to-put-on-and-remove-a-face-mask/) - a contaminated mask (from handling the inside with dirty fingers) doesn't help as much.
