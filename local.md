Most towns around Arlington also have Mutual Aid groups - self-organizing, indpendent volunteers helping neighbors out, either on a town/city-wide scale, or just a few blocks.  Here's a listing of all groups in neighboring towns to Arlington.  Next door in Medford/Somerville, the MAMAS group has also drawn up an [excellent categorized list of hundreds of aid links](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUKO9JnlO7JOg0RCnN0dLVym4ZE0zrn2LfuNXgNrC1M/preview), both for volunteers and those in need.
