### Got More Ideas?

[Email us your suggestions](mailto:MutualAidArlington@gmail.com?Subject=[MAA] Instock Suggestion) - we update this site frequently!  In particular, we want to know what to add:
- More stores?  If there's enough demand for specific stores, we'll add'em.
- Better reports? Should we color-code low stock stores?
- Other specific instock columns?  We can't add too many, but if we get a lot of specific requests we will.
- Ideas for better help for this page, especially on mobile (your neighborhood developer is always on their laptop...)
