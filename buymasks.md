## 2022 COVID Continues Update

Note that with the return of supply chains - even if slowly - most people now have access to proper blue surgical grade masks, or full N95/KN95 style masks.  Most of the mask makers below are probably not hand-making masks any more, although we do thank them for stepping up to help in such style!

See our [section on how to safely buy masks from reputable suppliers](/masks/).  There are still plenty of companies providing lower-quality masks with bogus marketing, so use caution.

Now that the [CDC recommends wearing cloth masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) when going out, we're all wondering where to get one for ourselves.  Even a simple mask helps prevent getting or transmitting diseases, and now we have a list of local mask makers who - after donating many to local drives or hospitals - have the capacity to sell masks for home use.
