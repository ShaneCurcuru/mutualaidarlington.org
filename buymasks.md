Now that the [CDC recommends wearing cloth masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) when going out, we're all wondering where to get one for ourselves.  Even a simple mask helps prevent getting or transmitting diseases, and now we have a list of local mask makers who - after donating many to local drives or hospitals - have the capacity to sell masks for home use.

_Need a pro mask or want to volunteer to sew?_ See our [overall mask and PPE guide](/masks/) for helping hospitals or first responders out.
