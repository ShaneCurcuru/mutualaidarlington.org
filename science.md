There are far too many COVID-related scientific resources out there to ever make a comprehensive list.  But here are a few key sites that provide some well-researched data that are easy to follow.

## COVID Tracking Data

- Arlington's own [MAVEN tracking of COVID in town](https://datastudio.google.com/embed/u/0/reporting/fc4fe603-f3e7-4aac-a278-b90f098bb43e/page/8FDMB).
- [Massachusetts state COVID dashboard](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting#covid-19-daily-dashboard-).
- [US-wide CDC COVID tracker](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#cases)
- [Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) has one of the best COVID trackers out there.
- [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-county-data-us.html) independently tracks all US COVID cases.

## Useful Graphs

- [RT.live](https://rt.live/) tracks the R0 number by state in the US.
- [CMMID mathematical modeling](https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/) of COVID spreading around the world. 
- The [COVID Tracking Project now maps racial testing disparities](https://covidtracking.com/race) from states that report them.

## Science Links

From a local doctor Robin, here are a handful of coronavirus-related studies that you can volunteer to apply for to help in the name of science.
